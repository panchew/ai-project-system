# Project Roadmap

## Vision

Build a **formal, repeatable project system** for AI-assisted software development that:
- Treats documentation as a first-class artifact
- Makes execution context explicit and derivable
- Enables parallel work without coordination overhead
- Scales from solo projects to team collaboration

This system eliminates the chaos of ephemeral chats and lost context.

## Completed Phases

### P0 – Project Formalization *(Retired)*

**Goal**: Bootstrap the repository and formalize the initial system contract.

**Status**: Retired (Completed 2026-01-25)

**Milestone**:
- **M0.1** – Repository Bootstrap *(Completed)*

---

### P1 – System Foundation & Adoption *(Fully Closed)*

**Goal**: Establish the AI Project System as a stable, adoptable, and self-hosting system.

**Status**: Fully Closed (Started 2026-01-14, Completed 2026-04-18)

**Milestones**:
- **M1** – Genesis & Integration Baseline *(Completed)*
- **M2** – Execution Ergonomics & Validation *(Completed)*
- **M3** – Governance Distribution & Adoption *(Completed)*
- **M4** – Adoption Readiness & Practical Enablement *(Completed)*
- **M5** – System Refinement from Real Usage *(Completed)*

**Key Deliverables**:
- ✅ Repository structure aligned with PROJECT-SYSTEM-GUIDELINES.md
- ✅ Authoritative governance documents published
- ✅ Complete phase/milestone/epic documentation framework
- ✅ Project tracker integration system
- ✅ Human review and acceptance framework
- ✅ Governance propagation model
- ✅ Templates and scaffolding
- ✅ Quick-start guide and visual documentation
- ✅ Example project and walkthrough
- ✅ FAQ, licensing, and community readiness
- ✅ Milestone/epic closure process specification
- ✅ Unplanned progress branch model
- ✅ Epic Execution Chat Starter format

### P2 – Adoption, Architecture & Multi-Project Support *(Completed)*

**Goal**: Evolve the governance model for multi-project support, CLI tooling, override boundaries, and adoption readiness.

**Status**: Completed (Consolidated to master 2026-05-22)

**Milestones**:
- **M6** – Governance Folder Restructure *(Completed)*
- **M7** – CLI Initialization Tool *(Completed)*
- **M8** – HQ Agent & End-to-End Validation *(Completed)*
- **M9** – Override Boundaries & System Refinement *(Completed)*
- **M10** – Adoption & Phase P2 Closure *(Completed)*

**Key Deliverables**:
- ✅ Restructured governance directory (`governance/`) with guides and templates
- ✅ `.ai-project.yml` configuration spec (v2.0.0+)
- ✅ Submodule support for multi-project governance distribution
- ✅ Migration guide for legacy users
- ✅ CLI initialization tool (`bin/ai-project-init`)
- ✅ HQ Agent deployment and end-to-end validation
- ✅ Override spec and precedence rules
- ✅ Adoption guides, FAQ, and multi-project onboarding

---

### P3 – Agentic Execution Model Maturity *(Completed)*

**Goal**: Transform the AI Project System from a human-mediated documentation framework into an unattended, 24/7 autonomous development cluster with file-driven state machines, sandboxing, and hybrid model routing.

**Status**: Completed (Consolidated to master 2026-05-24)

**Milestones**:
- **M11** – File-Driven Bus & State Triggers *(Completed)*
- **M12** – Containerized Sandbox & Loop Verification *(Completed)*
- **M13** – Orchestrator CLI Daemon *(Completed)*

**Key Deliverables**:
- ✅ `.ai-project/queue/` — File-driven message bus with JSON trigger schemas
- ✅ `bin/ai-project-orchestrator` — Core orchestration engine with 3-attempt Dev-QA loop
- ✅ `Dockerfile.sandbox` — Isolated container runtime for execution and validation
- ✅ `bin/ai-project-daemon` — Background service for continuous queue monitoring
- ✅ `bin/ai-project-git-merge` — Automated branch promotion and merge utility
- ✅ `bin/verify-loop.sh` — 5-scenario closed-loop verification harness (all passing)
- ✅ `bin/verify-daemon.sh` — Daemon lifecycle and integration test suite
- ✅ `bin/build-sandbox.sh` — Sandbox image builder
- ✅ Hybrid model routing (remote for planning, local for execution)
- ✅ Closed-loop execution with self-healing, 3-attempt ceiling, escalation reports
- ✅ Stale lock recovery and signal-based cleanup
- ✅ PROJECT-SYSTEM-GUIDELINES.md Sections 18A–18D (cluster execution rules)

## Future

### P4 – Unplanned *(Open for Discussion)*

**Goal**: TBD — options under consideration:

1. **System Operations** — Monitor, observe, and refine the autonomous cluster built in P3; create runbooks, dashboards, and operational maturity.
2. **Public Release** — Polish documentation, create reference example projects, prepare community contribution model per original roadmap vision.
3. **Team Collaboration** — Extend the system for multi-contributor workflows, access controls, shared contexts, multi-agent orchestration.
4. **Other** — As directed by project needs.

**Status**: Not started. Awaiting HQ Chat direction.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Document before execute**
2. **Chats are ephemeral, Markdown is authoritative**
3. **Structure enables intelligence**
4. **Explicit is better than implicit**
5. **Consistency over optimization**

---

## Current Focus

All planned phases (P1, P2, P3) are **completed and consolidated to master**.

No phase is currently active. The project is at a decision point: define and scope **Phase 4**.

- [`docs/phases/P2__Adoption_Architecture_and_Multi_Project_Support/`](../phases/P2__Adoption_Architecture_and_Multi_Project_Support/)
